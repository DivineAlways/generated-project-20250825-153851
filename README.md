# Spicy AI Content Creator Course Website

This project contains all the necessary files for a static website promoting a course on using AI to create spicy, engaging content.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections, accessible from the main `index.html` hub page:

-   **/docs**: Contains all project documentation in Markdown format. This includes the project overview, functional requirements, and user flow diagrams.
-   **/wireframes**: Contains low-fidelity HTML wireframes. These are basic structural layouts focusing on content hierarchy and user flow, not visual design.
-   **/prototype**: Contains a high-fidelity, interactive, and mobile-friendly prototype built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a clickable simulation of the final product.

## How to Use

1.  Open the root `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  From the hub, you can navigate to the documentation, wireframes, or the interactive prototype.
3.  All paths are relative, so the project should work without a web server.
